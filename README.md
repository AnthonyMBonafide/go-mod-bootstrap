# go-mod-bootstrap
This module contains the common bootstrap and dependency injection container originally implemented in the edgex-go repository and extracted here for non-core-service reuse.

### Installation ###
* Make sure you're using at least Go 1.11.1 and have modules enabled (i.e. have an initialized go.mod file).
* If your code is in your GOPATH then make sure ```GO111MODULE=on``` is set
* Run ```go get github.com/edgexfoundry/go-mod-bootstrap```
    * This will add go-mod-bootstrap to the go.mod file and download it into the module cache
